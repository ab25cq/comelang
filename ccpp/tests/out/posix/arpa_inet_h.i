 * arguments (meaning they can't dereference pointers).
 *
 * __stateful_pure can be used for functions that have no side effects,

 */

/* __unused denotes variables and functions that may not be used, preventing
 * the compiler from warning about it if not used.
 */

/* __used forces variables and functions to be included even if it appears
 * to the compiler that they are not used (and would thust be discarded).
 */

/* __cold marks code used for debugging or that is rarely taken
 * and tells the compiler to optimize for size and outline code.
 */

/* __returns_nonnull marks functions that return a non-null pointer. */

/* __exported denotes symbols that should be exported even when symbols
 * are hidden by default.
 * __exported_push/_exported_pop are pragmas used to delimit a range of

 */

/* __deprecated causes the compiler to produce a warning when encountering

 * __deprecated_msg() does the same, and compilers that support it will print
 * a message along with the deprecation warning.
 * This may require turning on such warning with the -Wdeprecated flag.
 * __deprecated_enum_msg() should be used on enums, and compilers that support
 * it will print the deprecation warning.
 * __kpi_deprecated() specifically indicates deprecation of kernel programming
 * interfaces in Kernel.framework used by KEXTs.

 * void	*malloc(size_t __size) __alloc_size(1);

/*
 * Facilities below assist adoption of -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, an off-by-default
 * Clang compiler warning that helps the developer minimize unsafe, raw
 * buffer manipulation in the code that may lead to buffer overflow
 * vulnerabilities.
 *
 * They are primarily designed for modern C++ code where -Wunsafe-buffer-usage
 * comes with automatic fix-it hints that help the developer transform
 * their code to use modern C++ containers, which may be made bounds-safe by
 * linking against a version of the C++ standard library that offers
 * bounds-checked containers.
 * They can be used in plain C, but -fbounds-safety is the preferred solution
 * for plain C (see also <ptrcheck.h>).
 *
 * Attribute __unsafe_buffer_usage can be used to label functions that should be
 * avoided as they may perform or otherwise introduce unsafe buffer
 * manipulation operations.
 *
 * Calls to such functions are flagged by -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, similarly to
 * how unchecked buffer manipulation operations are flagged when observed
 * by the compiler directly:
 *
 *   // An unsafe function that needs to be avoided.
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage
 *   void foo(int *buf, size_t size);
 *
 *   // A safe alternative to foo().
 *   void foo(std::span<int> buf);
 *
 *   void bar(size_t idx) {
 *       int array[5];
 *
 *       // Direct unsafe buffer manipulation through subscript operator:
 *       array[idx] = 3;  // warning [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Unsafe buffer manipulation through function foo():
 *       foo(array, 5);   // warning [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Checked buffer manipulation, with bounds information automatically
 *       // preserved for the purposes of runtime checks in standard library:
 *       foo(array);      // no warning
 *   }
 *
 * While annotating a function as __unsafe_buffer_usage has an effect similar
 * to annotating it as __attribute__((__deprecated__)), the __unsafe_buffer_usage attribute
 * should be used whenever the resulting warning needs to be controlled
 * by the -Wunsafe-buffer-usage flag (which is turned off in codebases that
 * don't attempt to achieve bounds safety this way) as opposed to -Wdeprecated
 * (enabled in most codebases).
 *
 * The attribute does NOT suppress -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings inside
 * the function's body; it simply introduces new warnings at each call site
 * to help the developers avoid the function entirely. Most of the time
 * it does not make sense to annotate a function as __unsafe_buffer_usage
 * without providing the users with a safe alternative.
 *
 * Pragmas __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin and __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 * annotate a range of code as intentionally containing unsafe buffer
 * operations. They suppress -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings
 * for unsafe operations in range:
 *
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin
 *   array[idx] = 3; // warning suppressed
 *   foo(array, 5);  // warning suppressed
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 *
 * These pragmas are NOT a way to mass-annotate functions with the attribute
 * __unsafe_buffer_usage. Functions declared within the pragma range
 * do NOT get annotated automatically. In some rare situations it makes sense
 * to do all three: put the attribute on the function, put pragmas inside
 * the body of the function, and put pragmas around some call sites.

/*
 * COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS -- see compat(5) for additional detail
 *
 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
 *		Apple API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.
 */

/* These settings are particular to each product. */
/* Platform: MacOSX */

/*
 * The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
 * legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintaining binary compatibility
 * while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
 *
 * __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
 * changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
 * if the signature has changed.  Because the 1 environment
 * only supports UNIX03 semantics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
 * defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
 *
 * As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
 * OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
 * will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
 * time 100 + minor version times 10 (__unreachable_ok_pop 	 _Pragma("clang diagnostic pop").g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targeting
 * pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
 * compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.

 * The rune type below is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural

 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __darwin_ct_rune_t instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
 * work.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also wint_t must be no narrower than

 * character set plus one extra value (WEOF). wint_t must be at least 16 bits.

 /*     
    These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
    and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
    were first available; and, if applicable, the OS versions in which they
    became deprecated and obsoleted.
     
    The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
    The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
    and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
    means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
    and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
    
    If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
    applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
            __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
    currently not implemented on the iPhone.

    At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
    recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a 
    better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
    functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
    macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
    as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
    became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function 
    has never been available.  
    
    For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range 
    it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
    -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
    when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
    but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
    Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.  
    
    Examples:

        A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);


        An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            @interface MyClass : NSObject
            -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
            @end

        
        An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
        
           Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because 
           __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero. 
        

        An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
		
			enum {
			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
				...
		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
			  

    It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
    source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
    to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
    That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not __DARWIN_64_BIT_INO_T 1 a later
    OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
    in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
    way.

/* 
 * __API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED is used as a version number in API that will be deprecated 
 * in an upcoming release. This soft deprecation is an intermediate step before formal 
 * deprecation to notify developers about the API before compiler warnings are generated.
 * You can find all places in your code that use soft deprecated API by redefining the 
 * value of this macro to your current minimum deployment target, for example:
 * (macOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=10.12 <other compiler flags>
 * (iOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=11.0 <other compiler flags>

/*
 * Constraining pointer types based on contracts.
 *
 * 1. List of supported constrained pointers.
 *
 * 1.1. `Reference' pointers.
 *
 *      The `reference' pointers point to a single entity. The pointer
 *      arithmetics are not supported for the `reference' pointers.
 *
 *      The `reference' pointers are fully ABI compatible with
 *      the unconstrained C pointers.
 *
 *      The naming convention for the `reference' pointers uses
 *      the `ref' constraint tag. See `Naming conventions' below for furhter
 *      discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ref_t' is `reference' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `uint32_ref_t' is `reference' pointer to `uint32_t'.
 *
 *
 * 1.2. `Checked' pointers.
 *
 *      The `checked' pointers represent contigous data arrays, which
 *      can be traversed only in the direction of increasing memory addresses.
 *      The pointer arithmetics are partially supported: decrements (p--, --p)
 *      are disallowed.
 *
 *      The `checked' pointers are not ABI-compatible with plain C pointers,
 *      due to the boundary checks instrumentation. See `ABI
 *      Compatibility Considerations' below for further discussion.
 *
 *      The naming convention for the `checked' pointers uses the `ptr'
 *      constraint tag. See `Naming conventions' below for furhter discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ptr_t' is `checked' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `uint32_ptr_t' is `checked' pointer to `uint32_t'.
 *
 *
 * 1.3. `Bidirectional' pointers.
 *
 *      The `bidirectional' pointers represent contigous data arrays,
 *      which can be traversed in both directions. The pointer arithmetics are
 *      fully supported for the `array' pointers.
 *
 *      The `bidirectional' pointers are not ABI-compatible with plain C
 *      pointers, due to the boundary checks instrumentation. Additionally,
 *      passing `bidirectional' pointers to functions require the use of stack.
 *      See `ABI Compatibility Considerations' below for further discussion.
 *
 *      The naming convention for the `bidirectional' pointers uses
 *      the `bptr' constraint tag. See `Naming conventions' below for furhter
 *      discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_bptr_t' is `bidirectional' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `uint32_bptr_t' is `bidirectional' pointer to `uint32_t'.
 *
 *
 * 1.4. Multidimensional constrained pointers.
 *
 *      Constraining multidimensional pointers is achieved by iteratively
 *      applying the constraints from the innermost type to the outermost type.
 *
 *      Pointer arithmetics are supported for the dimensions that
 *      are not constrained to a `reference' or `const reference'.
 *
 *      If any of the dimension constraints isn't ABI-compatible with its
 *      unconstrained counterpart, then the entire constrained multidimensional
 *      pointer is not ABI-compatible with the corresponding unconstrained
 *      multidimensional pointer. Otherwise, the two are ABI-compatible. See
 *      `ABI compatibility' below for further discussion.
 *
 *      The naming convention for the multidimensional constrained pointers
 *      combines the naming tags that correspond to the individual constraints.
 *      See `Naming conventions' below for furhter discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ref_bptr_t' is a `bidirectional' pointer to a `reference'
 *          pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `socket_ptr_ref_t' is a `reference' pointer to a `checked'
 *          pointer to `struct socket'.
 *
 *
 * 1.5. Using `const', `volatile', and `restrict' type qualifiers with
 *      constrained types.
 *
 *      The use of the `const', `volatile', and `restrict' type qualifiers
 *      (a.k.a. "CRV qualifiers") follows the syntax of the C language.
 *
 *      As a special case, if a `const' qualifier is applied to inner
 *      dimensions of a multidimensional constrained pointer type, the
 *      constraint tag is prepended with letter `c'; thus `cref' can be used
 *      for const-qualified `reference' pointer. This abbreviation is only
 *      supported for the `const' qualifier, as use of `volatile' or `restrict'
 *      for inner constrained types is quite uncommon. See `Multidimensional
 *      constrained pointers' above and `Naming conventions' below for further
 *      discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ref_t const' is the const-qualified `reference' pointer
 *          to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `socket_ptr_t volatile' is the volatile-qualified `checked' pointer
 *          to `struct socket'.
 *      (3) `socket_ptr_ref_t const' is a const-qualified `reference' pointer
 *          to a `checked' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (4) `socket_cref_ptr_t const' is a `checked' pointer to a
 *          const-qualified `reference' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *
 *
 * 1.6. Combining constrained pointers and unconstrained pointers.
 *
 *      Unconstrained pointers to constrained pointers follow
 *      the standard C syntax. Defining constrained pointers to
 *      unconstrained pointers is possible via defining a constrained pointer
 *      to a typedef.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ref_t *' is an unconstrained pointer to `socket_ref_t', i.__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED 100000.
 *          unconstrained pointer to a `reference' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `socket_ref_t const *' is an unconstrained pointer to `socket_ref_t const',
 *          i.__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED 100000. an unconstrained pointer to a const-qualified `reference'
 *          pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (3) `socket_ref_t * const' is a const-qualified unconstrained pointer to
 *          `socket_ref_t', i.e. a const-qualified unconstrained pointer to a
 *          `reference' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (4) `intptr_ref_t' is a `reference' pointer to `intptr_t', i.e.
 *          a `reference' pointer to an unconstrained pointer to `int'. Note
 *          the use of `intptr_t' typedef, which is necessary at the moment.
 *
 *
 * 2. Defining constrained pointer types.
 *
 * 2.1. Declaring multiple constrained types simultaneously.
 *
 *      `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPES(basetype, basetag)`
 *      is the suggested way to declare constrained pointer types.
 *
 *      Parameters:
 *
 *      `basetype`: the pointee type, including `struct' or `enum' keywords.
 *      `basetag`:  the prefix of the constrained type.
 *
 *      This macro acts differently in the user-space and the kernel-space
 *      code.
 *      When used in the user-space code, the macro will declare
 *      types which are ABI-safe. See `ABI Compatibility Considerations'
 *      below for more details on ABI-safety. In the user-space code,
 *      the macro is guarded by the `__CCT_ENABLE_USER_SPACE' compilation
 *      flag.
 *      When used in the kernel-space code, the macro will declare
 *      the common constrained types.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) When used from the user space, and `__CCT_ENABLE_USER_SPACE'
 *          is defined, the expression
 *          `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPES(struct socket, socket);'
 *           will declare types:
 *
 *          (a) `socket_ref_t': the `reference' to `struct socket'
 *          (b) `socket_ref_ref_t': the `reference to reference'
 *              to `struct socket'.
 *
 *      (2) When used from the kernel space,
 *          `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPES(struct socket, socket);'
 *           will declare the above types, plus:
 *
 *          (c) `socket_ptr_t': `checked' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *          (d) `socket_bptr_t': `bidirectional' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *          (__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED 100000) `socket_ref_ptr_t': `checked' pointer to a `reference'
 *              to `struct socket'.
 *          (f) `socket_ptr_ref_t': `reference' to a `checked' pointer
 *              to `struct socket'.
 *
 *      These additional types are not ABI-safe, and therefore are not exposed
 *      to the user space. See `ABI Compatibility Considerations' below.
 *
 *
 * 2.2. Declaring individual constrained types.
 *
 *      The above macro attempts to do many things at once, and under some
 *      circumstances can be not appropriate. For these circumstances, a
 *      finer-graned declarator can be used:
 *
 *      `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPE(basetype, basetag, ...)'
 *
 *      Parameters:
 *
 *      `basetype`: the pointee type.
 *      `basetag`:  the prefix of the constrained type.
 *      `...`:      list of constraints:
 *                  - `__CCT_REF' for the "reference" contract;
 *                  - `__CCT_CREF' for the "const reference" contract;
 *                  - `__CCT_PTR' for the "checked pointer" contract; or
 *                  - `__CCT_BPTR' for the "bidirectional pointer" contract.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPE(struct socket, socket, __CCT_REF)'
 *          will declare the type
 *              `reference' pointer to `struct socket'
 *          and call this type by `socket_ref_t'
 *
 *      (2) `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPE(struct socket, socket, __CCT_REF, __CCT_PTR)'
 *          will declare the type
 *              `checked' pointer to `socket_ref_t'
 *          which in turn is equivalent to the type
 *              `checked' pointer to `reference' pointer to `struct socket'
 *
 *      (3) `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPE(struct socket, socket, __CCT_REF, __CCT_PTR, __CCT_REF)'
 *          will declare the type
 *              `reference' pointer to `socket_ref_ptr_t'
 *          which is equivalent to the type
 *              `reference' pointer to `checked' pointer to `socket_ref_t'
 *          which in turn is equivalent to the type
 *              `reference' pointer to `checked' pointer to `reference' pointer to `struct socket'
 *
 *
 * 3. Using constrained pointer types.
 *
 * 3.1. Using constrained pointers for local variables.
 *
 *      Constraining the pointers on the stack reduces the risk of stack
 *      overflow. Therefore, it is highly suggested to use the constrained
 *      versions of the pointers for stack parameters. For local array
 *      variables, opt for the `bidirectional' pointers. If only a single value
 *      needs to be pointed, opt for the `reference' pointers.
 *
 *      There are two alternative approaches for using the `reference' pointers.
 *      One approach is to explicitly use `thing_ref_t ptr` instead of `thing *ptr`.
 *      The other approach is to surround the code with the directives
 *      `' and `__ASSUME_PTR_ABI_SINGLE_END', which
 *      will have the effect of turning every unconstrained pointer to its
 *      `reference' counterpart.
 *
 *
 * 3.2. Using constrained pointers for function parameters
 *
 * 3.2.1. Use `reference' pointers for scalar parameters.
 *
 *      Scalar parameters are safe to use across ABI boundaries.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using `reference' pointers for scalar input:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_is_valid(const thing_ref_t t)
 *      {
 *              return t == NULL ? EINVAL : 0;
 *      }
 *
 *
 *      (2) Using `reference' pointers for scalar output, which is
 *          allocated by the caller:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_copy(const thing_ref_t src, thing_ref_t dst)
 *      {
 *              if (src == NULL || dst == NULL) {
 *                      return EINVAL;
 *              }
 *              bcopy(src, dst);
 *              return 0;
 *      }
 *
 *      (3) Using `reference to reference' for scalar output that is
 *          allocated by the callee:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_dup(const thing_ref_t src, thing_ref_ref_t dst)
 *      {
 *              *dst = malloc(sizeof(*dst));
 *              bcopy(src, *dst, sizeof(*src));
 *              return 0;
 *      }
 *
 *
 * 3.2.2. Use `checked' pointers for vector parameters.
 *
 *      When the ABI isn't a concern, use of `checked' pointers
 *      increases the code readability.
 *
 *      See `ABI Compatibility Considerations' below for vector parameters when
 *      ABI is a concern.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using `checked' pointers for vector input:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_find_best(const thing_ref_ptr_t things,
 *                              thing_ref_ref_t best, size_t count)
 *      {
 *              for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
 *                      if (thing_is_the_best(things[i])) {
 *                              *best = things[i];
 *                              return 0;
 *                      }
 *              }
 *              return ENOENT; // no best thing
 *      }
 *
 *      (2) Using `checked' pointers for vector output parameters that
 *          are allocated by caller:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_copy_things(thing_ref_ptr_t src, thing_ref_ptr_t dst,
 *                                size_t count)
 *      {
 *              for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
 *                      dst[i] = malloc(sizeof(*dst[i]));
 *                      bcopy(src[i], dst[i], sizeof(*src[i]));
 *              }
 *              return 0;
 *      }
 *
 *      (3) Using `reference to checked' pointers for vector output
 *      parameters that are allocated by callee:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_dup_things(thing_ref_ptr_t src, thing_ref_ptr_ref_t dst,
 *                               size_t count)
 *      {
 *              *dst = malloc(sizeof(**src) * count);
 *              return thing_copy_things(src, *dst, count);
 *      }
 *
 *
 * 3.3. Using constrained pointers in struct definitions
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using a structure that points to array of things:
 *
 *      struct things_crate {
 *              size_t       tc_count;
 *              thing_bptr_t tc_things;
 *      };
 *
 *
 * 4. ABI Compatibility Considerations
 *
 *      The pointer instrumentation process has ABI implications.
 *
 *      When the pointer insrumentation is enabled, the size of `bidirectional'
 *      and `checked' pointers exceeds the size of the machine word.
 *
 *      Thus, if there is a concern that the instrumentation is enabled only in
 *      some compilation units that use the function, these constrained
 *      pointers can not be used for function parameters.
 *
 *      Instead, one should rely on `' or `__sized_by(size)'
 *      attributes. These attributes accept as a parameter the name of a
 *      variable that contains the cont of items, or the byte size, of the
 *      pointed-to array. Use of these attributes does not change the size of
 *      the pointer.
 *
 *      The tradeoff is between maintaining code readabilty and ABI compatibility.
 *
 *      A common pattern is to split the function into the implementation,
 *      which is statically linked and therefore is ABI-safe, and the interface
 *      wrapper, which uses `__counted_by' or `__sized_by' to preserve ABI
 *      compatibility.
 *
 *
 * 4.1. When ABI is a concern, replace `bidirectional' and `checked'
 *        with  `` and `` for vector
 *        parameters.
 *
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using `const thing_ref_t ' instead of `const
 *          thing_ref_ptr_t' for vector input in a wrapper:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_find_best_compat(const thing_ref_t things,
 *                                     thing_ref_ref_t best, size_t count)
 *      {
 *              // __counted_by implicitly upgraded to `checked'
 *              return thing_find_best(things, best, count);
 *      }
 *
 *      (2) Using `thing_ref_t ' instead of `thing_ref_ptr_t'
 *          for vector output in a wrapper.
 *
 *      errno_t thing_copy_things_compat(thing_ref_t src,
 *                                       things_ref_t dst,
 *                                       size_t count)
 *      {
 *              // __counted_by implicitly upgraded to `checked'
 *              return thing_copy_things(src, dst, count);
 *      }
 *
 *
 * 4.2. When ABI is a concern, use `' and
 *        `' for struct members that point to arrays.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using a structure that points to array of things:
 *
 *      struct things_crate {
 *              size_t                               tc_count;
 *              struct thing * tc_things;
 *      };
 *
 * 5. Naming conventions
 *
 *      If `typename' is the name of a C type, and `tag' is a constraint tag
 *      (one of `ref', `ptr', or `bptr'), then the name of a pointer to
 *      `typename' constrained by `tag' is `basetag_tag_t', where `basename'
 *      is defined by:
 *
 *      (a) If `typename' is a name of an integral type, then `basetag' is same
 *          as `typename'.
 *      (b) If `typename' is a name of a function type, then `basetag' is same
 *          as `typename'.
 *      (c) If `typename' is a name of a structure, then `basetag' is formed by
 *          stripping the `struct' keyword from `typename'.
 *      (d) If `typename' is a name of an enumeration, then `basetag' is formed
 *          by stripping the `enum' keyword from `typename'.
 *      (__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED 100000) If `typename' is a name of a typedef to a struct or an enum that ends
 *          with `_t', then `basetag' is formed by stripping the `_t' suffix
 *          from `typename'. See (h) below for when `typename' is a pointer typedef.
 *      (f) If `typename' is a name of constrained pointer type ending with `_t',
 *          then `basetag' is formed by stripping the `_t' suffix from `typename'.
 *
 *      Additionally, constrained pointers to constrained const pointers are a
 *      special case:
 *
 *      (g) If `typename' is a name of a constrained pointer type, ending with
 *          `_{innertag}_t', and `typename' has `const' qualifier, then `basetag'
 *          is formed by replacing `_{innertag}_t' with `_c{innertag}'
 *
 *      Finally, sometimes `name_t' represents not `struct name' but `struct name *'.
 *      This creates additional special case:
 *
 *      (h) If `typename' is a pointer typedef named `{struct}_t`, such as
 *          `mbuf_t',  then creating a constrained pointer to a `typename' would
 *           require creating a  constrained pointer to an unconstrained pointer,
 *           which is not supported at the moment. Instead, a constrained pointer to
 *           `typeof(*typename)` must be created first, and constrained again. Using
 *           the `mbuf_t` example, first one should create a constrained pointer to
 *           `struct mbuf`, __API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED 100000.g, `mbuf_bptr_t`, and then constrain it again with
 *           `tag`, leading to `mbuf_bptr_ref_t'.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `int_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `int', following the rule (a) above.
 *      (2) `so_pru_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to function `so_pru',
 *          following the rule (b) above.
 *      (3) `socket_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `struct socket',
 *          following the rule (c) above.
 *      (4) `classq_pkt_type_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `enum classq_pkt_type'
 *          following the rule (d) above.
 *      (5) `classq_pkt_type_ref_t' is a also `reference pointer' to `classq_pkt_type_t'
 *          following the rule (__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED 100000) above.
 *      (6) `socket_ref_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `socket_ref_t`,
 *          following the rule (f) above.
 *      (7) `socket_cref_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `socket_ref_t const`,
 *          following the rule (g) above.
 *      (8) `mbuf_ref_ref_t', is a `reference pointer' to `mbuf_ref_t`, and is one
 *          possible result of creating a `reference pointer' to `mbuf_t',
 *          following the rule (h) above.
 *      (9) `mbuf_bptr_ref_t', is a `reference pointer' to `mbuf_bptr_t`, and
 *          is another possible result of creating a `reference pointer' to
 *          `mbuf_t', following the rule (h) above.

/* When adding new socket-options, you need to make sure MPTCP supports these as well! */

/*
 * Network Service Type for option 0x1116  /* Network service type */
 *
 * The vast majority of sockets should use Best Effort that is the default
 * Network Service Type. Other Network Service Types have to be used only if
 * the traffic actually matches the description of the Network Service Type.
 *
 * Network Service Types do not represent priorities but rather describe
 * different categories of delay, jitter and loss parameters.
 * Those parameters may influence protocols from layer 4 protocols like TCP
 * to layer 2 protocols like Wi-Fi. The Network Service Type can determine
 * how the traffic is queued and scheduled by the host networking stack and
 * by other entities on the network like switches and routers. For example
 * for Wi-Fi, the Network Service Type can select the marking of the
 * layer 2 packet with the appropriate WMM Access Category.
 *
 * There is no point in attempting to game the system and use
 * a Network Service Type that does not correspond to the actual
 * traffic characteristic but one that seems to have a higher precedence.
 * The reason is that for service classes that have lower tolerance
 * for delay and jitter, the queues size is lower than for service
 * classes that are more tolerant to delay and jitter.
 *
 * For example using a voice service type for bulk data transfer will lead
 * to disastrous results as soon as congestion happens because the voice
 * queue overflows and packets get dropped. This is not only bad for the bulk
 * data transfer but it is also bad for VoIP apps that legitimately are using
 * the voice  service type.
 *
 * The characteristics of the Network Service Types are based on the service
 * classes defined in RFC 4594 "Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service
 * Classes"
 *
 * When system detects the outgoing interface belongs to a DiffServ domain
 * that follows the recommendation of the IETF draft "Guidelines for DiffServ to
 * IEEE 802.11 Mapping", the packet will marked at layer 3 with a DSCP value
 * that corresponds to Network Service Type.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BE
 *	"Best Effort", unclassified/standard.  This is the default service
 *	class and cover the majority of the traffic.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BK
 *	"Background", high delay tolerant, loss tolerant. elastic flow,
 *	variable size & long-lived. E.g: non-interactive network bulk transfer
 *	like synching or backup.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_RD
 *	"Responsive Data", a notch higher than "Best Effort", medium delay
 *	tolerant, elastic & inelastic flow, bursty, long-lived. E.g. email,
 *	instant messaging, for which there is a sense of interactivity and
 *	urgency (user waiting for output).
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_OAM
 *	"Operations, Administration, and Management", medium delay tolerant,
 *	low-medium loss tolerant, elastic & inelastic flows, variable size.
 *	E.g. VPN tunnels.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_AV
 *	"Multimedia Audio/Video Streaming", medium delay tolerant, low-medium
 *	loss tolerant, elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate
 *	and size. E.g. video and audio playback with buffering.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_RV
 *	"Responsive Multimedia Audio/Video", low delay tolerant, low-medium
 *	loss tolerant, elastic flow, variable packet interval, rate and size.
 *	E.g. screen sharing.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_VI
 *	"Interactive Video", low delay tolerant, low-medium loss tolerant,
 *	elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate & size. E.g.
 *	video telephony.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_SIG
 *	"Signaling", low delay tolerant, low loss tolerant, inelastic flow,
 *	jitter tolerant, rate is bursty but short, variable size. E.g. SIP.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_VO
 *	"Interactive Voice", very low delay tolerant, very low loss tolerant,
 *	inelastic flow, constant packet rate, somewhat fixed size.
 *	E.g. VoIP.

/*
 * Local port number conventions:
 *
 * When a user does a bind(2) or connect(2) with a port number of zero,
 * a non-conflicting local port address is chosen.
 * The default range is IPPORT_RESERVED through
 * IPPORT_USERRESERVED, although that is settable by sysctl.
 *
 * A user may set the 0               /* dummy for IP */ option IP_PORTRANGE to change this
 * default assignment range.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_DEFAULT causes the default behavior.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_HIGH changes the range of candidate port numbers
 * into the "high" range.  These are reserved for client outbound connections
 * which do not want to be filtered by any firewalls.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_LOW changes the range to the "low" are
 * that is (by convention) restricted to privileged processes.  This
 * convention is based on "vouchsafe" principles only.  It is only secure
 * if you trust the remote host to restrict these ports.
 *
 * The default range of ports and the high range can be changed by
 * sysctl(3).  (net.inet.ip.port{hi,low}{first,last}_auto)
 *
 * Changing those values has bad security implications if you are
 * using a a stateless firewall that is allowing packets outside of that
 * range in order to allow transparent outgoing connections.
 *
 * Such a firewall configuration will generally depend on the use of these
 * default values.  If you change them, you may find your Security
 * Administrator looking for you with a heavy object.
 *
 * For a slightly more orthodox text view on this:
 *
 *            ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/port-numbers
 *
 *    port numbers are divided into three ranges:
 *
 *                0 -  1023 Well Known Ports
 *             1024 - 49151 Registered Ports
